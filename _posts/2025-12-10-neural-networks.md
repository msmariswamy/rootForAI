Dive into the world of neural networks and understand how they power modern AI.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a computing system inspired by biological neural networks that form animal brains.

### The Perceptron

The simplest neural network component is the perceptron:

```
Input → Weight → Sum → Activation → Output
```

### Architecture

Neural networks consist of:
- **Input Layer**: Receives data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information
- **Output Layer**: Produces predictions

## How Neural Networks Learn

1. **Forward Propagation**: Input passes through the network
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare prediction to actual value
3. **Backpropagation**: Calculate gradients
4. **Optimization**: Update weights using gradient descent

## Deep Learning

Deep learning refers to neural networks with many hidden layers. These "deep" networks can learn complex patterns and representations.

## Applications

- Image classification
- Speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Game playing (AlphaGo, Chess)

## Frameworks

Popular deep learning frameworks:
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Google's deep learning library
- **PyTorch**: Facebook's deep learning framework
- **JAX**: Google's high-performance numerical computing library
