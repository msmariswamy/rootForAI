> *Artificial Intelligence is no longer science‑fiction; it’s reshaping how we live, work, and create.*

When you're starting with Artificial Intelligence, it's easy to get confused by all the buzzwords. Below we break it down into two main goals:

### Two Main Goals in AI

1. **Predicting the Future** – *What will happen?*
   *Examples:* forecasting sales, predicting customer churn, recommending products.
2. **Understanding the Past** – *What happened and why?*
   *Examples:* analyzing why sales dropped, segmenting customers, discovering hidden patterns.

#### When You Want to Predict
- **Machine Learning** – learns patterns from historical data to make predictions.
- **Deep Learning** – advanced ML using neural networks for large, complex data (e.g., image recognition, self‑driving cars).
- **Time Series Analysis** – specialized for data that changes over time, useful for forecasting.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – lets computers understand and predict based on human language (chatbots, sentiment analysis).

#### When You Want to Explore the Data
- **Data Science** – uses statistics, visualisation, and exploratory analysis to tell the story hidden in your data.

#### Key Difference
- **Prediction approaches** → forward‑looking – *What’s next?*
- **Data‑science analysis** → backward‑looking – *What happened and why?*
