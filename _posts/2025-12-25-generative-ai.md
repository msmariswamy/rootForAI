## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI creates new content that resembles human-created data.

## Generative Models

### Transformer-based Generative Models

- **GPT Series**: Text generation models
- **LLaMA**: Open weight language models
- **Mistral**: Efficient large language models

### Image Generation

- **DALL-E**: Text-to-image generation
- **Stable Diffusion**: Latent diffusion models
- **Midjourney**: Commercial image generation

## How Generative Models Work

### Text Generation

1. **Tokenization**: Input text is broken into tokens
2. **Prediction**: Model predicts next token based on context
3. **Sampling**: Choose tokens with temperature control
4. **Decoding**: Convert tokens back to text

### Image Generation

Generative models like Stable Diffusion work by:
1. **Diffusion Process**: Add noise to images
2. **Reverse Process**: Learn to remove noise
3. **Latent Space**: Generate in compressed representation

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data:

| Model | Parameters | Key Feature |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| GPT-4 | ~1.7T | Multi-modal capabilities |
| Claude 3 | ~100B | Excellent reasoning |
| Llama 3 | ~70B | Open source |

## Applications

- Content creation
- Code generation
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Image and video generation
- Music composition

## Ethical Considerations

- Bias in generated content
- Copyright and intellectual property
- Deepfakes and misinformation
- Environmental impact of training
