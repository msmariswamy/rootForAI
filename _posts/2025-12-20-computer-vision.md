How computers interpret and understand visual information from the world.

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision enables machines to interpret and understand digital images and videos.

## Key Computer Vision Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Image Classification | Identifying what's in an image |
| Object Detection | Finding and localizing multiple objects |
| Image Segmentation | Dividing an image into segments |
| Face Detection | Identifying human faces |
| Pose Estimation | Determining body position |

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are the backbone of modern computer vision:

```
Input → Convolution → ReLU → Pooling → Fully Connected → Output
```

### Key Concepts

- **Convolution**: Applying filters to extract features
- **ReLU**: Activation function that introduces non-linearity
- **Pooling**: Down-sampling to reduce dimensions
- **Fully Connected**: Final classification layer

## Pre-trained Models

Popular computer vision models:

- **ResNet**: Residual Networks for deep learning
- **YOLO**: Real-time object detection
- **U-Net**: Medical image segmentation
- **MobileNet**: Efficient mobile vision models

## Applications

- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical imaging analysis
- Security and surveillance
- Augmented reality
- Quality control in manufacturing
